It appears that you need application:

that uses “rich UI” - uses iconographics, etc.
able to run on different hardware configurations - standard and high-DPI monitors.
supports different locales/languages.
with distribution as compact as possible as this is a utility.
If so I would consider Sciter (HTML/CSS/SVG/script UI engine). And Sciter has Python bindings already.
